          Our climbing community at Fjellhallen is made up by climbers who share
          a common passion for adventure and vertical exploration. Within our
          walls, climbers of all skill levels come together to make connections,
          exchange tips, and celebrate the shared joy of rock climbing. It's a
          welcoming space where beginners find encouragement from seasoned
          climbers, and where experienced climbers discover new challenges to
          conquer.

          <p tabindex="0">
            Gjøvik climbing club was established in 2003 by keen climbers in
            Gjøvik who wanted a better organization of climbing activities. The
            number of members and active climbers has multiplied since the club
            was started. Gjøvik climbing club offers courses both indoors and
            outdoors for beginners and technique courses for beginners and
            established climbers.
