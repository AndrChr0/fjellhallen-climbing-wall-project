To tie the figure eight knot, grab the end of the rope in one hand, then extend your arm and measure out a length from your fist to your opposite shoulder.

00:08.000 --> 00:16.000
Hold up that bite and twist it one full rotation so that the standing part of the rope crosses over the working side, then comes around again to its original position.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Now pass the end of the rope back through the loop.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Next, pass the end of the rope through both the tie-in points on your harness and pull the knot in close to you.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Now feed the rope back through the knot, tracing the original as you go.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
You want the working end to run completely parallel to the standing part of the original knot.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
Once you've worked the end all the way through, dress the knot by making sure the strands are neat and parallel, then tighten the knot by pulling each strand tight individually.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Make sure you have at least six inches of tail, and you can check the knot by counting five sets of parallel lines.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
You'll use the figure eight all the time because it's the most common way to tie the rope into your harness.
