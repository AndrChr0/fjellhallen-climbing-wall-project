          <p tabindex="0">
            Our “classic” wall, also known as the “main wall”, is a large
            climbing wall that suits all experience levels. The grades range
            from 5 to 8. On the far-right side of the wall there are two “auto
            belay” systems so that you can climb with a rope without being
            belayed by another person. The wall is 10 to 13 meters high and 25
            meters wide, making it the biggest climbing wall in Gjøvik.

            Our competition wall contains a steep overhang and cater to more
            advanced climbers. Many regional cups are held at this very wall.
            All routes on this wall are set by professional route-setters with
            experience from national competitions and world cups. The wall is 15
            meters high, and has about 20 routes with grades ranging from 6+ to
            9. The wall is located between the bouldering wall an the classic
            wall.

          <p tabindex="0">
            The bouldering wall is the most popular of all our walls. Bouldering
            is about climbing short routes without a rope and falling on padding
            instead of being kept safe by a rope. It does not require any course
            certification to do bouldering. This is why it is popular for first
            timers. The bouldering wall has grades from 4+ to 7a/7b.

            For physically impaired climbers, there are special entrances and an
            elevator to get to the climbing walls. You will see the elevator to
            your right-hand side when entering Fjellhallen. Our instructors are
            available to assist you with anything you need, be it belaying or
            specialized climbing gear.
